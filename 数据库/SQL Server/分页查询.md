1. Top Not IN 方式（查询靠前的数据较快）

   ```sql
   SELECT TOP(条数) * FROM tablename WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT top pageSize*(pageIndex-1) Id FROM tablename);
   ```

2. ROW_NUMBER() OVER() 方式

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Id ) AS RowNumber FROM tablename ) as b WHERE RowNumber BETWEEN (pageIndex-1*pageSize) AND (pageIndex*pageSize);
   ```

3. ```sql
   select * from tableName order by id offset (pageIndex) * pageSize row fetch next pageSize row only;
   ```
